In a country where a human being has easier access to a cellphone than to a clean toilet, I found it extremely suprising that none of the cellphone service providers have a standardized/instantaneous process for activation of your cellphone service.

I had to wait nearly 2 days for activation for my service. Everytime I contacted customer service, the answer I got was they were working on it. The ETA that I was given was somewhere along the lines of 5 mins - 15 mins. Duh!

Why can't these companies instantly activate a cellphone line? Hard to understand!
