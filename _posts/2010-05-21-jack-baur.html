Finished watching the first season of 24 on Netflix instant play. Seriously awesome political thriller! Completely fell in love with it. I have heard people rave about it and understood why.

Liked Kiefer Sutherland as the indomitable and revered "Jack Baur".  The concept of 24 episodes each depicting the events for the hour in real-time is a cool idea.

Just getting started with "Season 2".
