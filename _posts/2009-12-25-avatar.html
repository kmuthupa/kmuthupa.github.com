Yes, by now we all know why <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/">Avatar</a> rocks! We also know the writing could have been better (Avatar = Dances with the wolves + Matrix).&nbsp; So there is no point me writing a full fledged review of this movie. Just pouring out some interesting thoughts that came to my mind after I watched the movie.<br /><br />I honestly dont think <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800012402">James Cameron</a> can hope to create a franchise out of this unless he has better written material for the sequels. The first time was a charm because of the stunning CGI that pulled masses to the theaters. Not sure if he can keep repeating this without a solid script backing the technology!<br /><br />Even with the lackluster script, I think the millions that was spent on making this movie was well spent because of the monumental achievement in terms of technology.&nbsp; The movie is raking in the moolah and  might become profitable sooner than we think. I pray the movie matches Titanic's box-office performance which would certify Cameron's ability to make mega budget movies financially viable.<br /><br />Hail the "The King of the World"!<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://intellisenze.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/avatar1jpg-f70d0dd4a4f277bc_large.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="http://intellisenze.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/avatar1jpg-f70d0dd4a4f277bc_large.jpg?w=300" /></a><br /></div><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
