Happened to try out <a href="http://github.com/plataformatec/devise" target="_blank">Devise </a>in my new rails project. Must say it is a great plugin that has impressed me for the following reasons :
<ul>
	<li>A piece of cake to implement. The documentation and help-me references are truly helpful and answer a number of questions that you might have about the plugin.</li>
	<li>Apart from being a flexible authentication solution, It has got a bunch of useful modules for things like setting up a user registration/confirmation feature for your web app,  forgot/reset password feature etc. The best part is you choose what you want to use.</li>
	<li>The plugin also provides a number of hooks to let you override certain aspects of the implementation. So, it is extensible as well.</li>
	<li>The necessary custom routes for the different devise controllers are generated seamlessly by using a devise_for :resource in your routes.  There are other interesting things that you can do here as well.</li>
</ul>
I worked on a user welcome email feature for the project which I think could be another module that could add value to Devise. Hope to contribute sometime soon.
