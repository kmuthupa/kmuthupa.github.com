I recently came across this inherent feature Rails provides to modularize or break down huge ActiveRecord models into reusable chunks or concerns. This way, these concerns are now pluggable into several different models where there would be a need for them. Not sure how many folks out there are aware of this nice little thing. I did'nt for sure until couple of days ago.

module Pluggable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    extend ClassMethods
    include InstanceMethods
  end

  module ClassMethods
     
  end

  module InstanceMethods
     
  end
end

class Plug 
  include Pluggable
end
</div>
