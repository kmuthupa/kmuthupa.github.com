So <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opera-mini-web-browser/id363729560?mt=8" target="_blank">Opera Mini for the iPhone</a>got approved and is available in the App store since last night.&nbsp; Idownloaded it this morning and should say I am mighty impressed withit. It is zippy, fast and intuitive.&nbsp; There was a quite a bit of <a href="http://www.pathf.com/blogs/2010/04/opera-apples-netscape/" target="_blank">speculation</a> around whether this would get approved by Apple.&nbsp; I m happy that Apple approved it.<br />I did notice a few quirks with the Browser but they are in no waydeal-breakers. From my brief interaction with it, the browser looksawesome to me! I dont deny Safari being a solid mobile browser itselfbut with Opera out now, its "Bye-Bye Safari" for me :)<br /><div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl class="wp-caption aligncenter"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img alt="photo" class="size-full wp-image-5004 " height="480" src="http://www.pathf.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/photo.jpg" width="320" /></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">Opera Mini for the iPhone</dd></dl></div>
