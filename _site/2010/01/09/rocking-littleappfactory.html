After hunting around for the last few weeks for a free, zippy and reliable iPod music ripper for Mac, my search culminated <a href="http://thelittleappfactory.com/irip/">here</a>. Even though I ended up paying for iRip, I believe it was worth it after my initial experiences with the software. It lets you interface with iPod, iPhone or any other music device and transfer music with ease.<br /><br />The LittleAppFactory also has other awesome software like the <a href="http://thelittleappfactory.com/evom/">Evom</a> that lets convert movies and youtube videos to ipod compatible formats, <a href="http://thelittleappfactory.com/ripit/">RipIt</a> that lets you rip movies from DVDs etc. I have tried both of these and they are super-efficient and easy to use just like iRip.<br /><br />Great job, LittleAppFactory! <br /><br /><br />P.S these are software for Mac.<br />
