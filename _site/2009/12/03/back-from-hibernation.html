I started this blog early this year hoping to be an active blogger.  For whatever reasons, I never really had the drive to keep myself  active after the first two posts I made.Now, I want to renew my interest for this blog!  :-)Stay tuned to this blog to hear my rants/blather/whatever-you-want-to- call-it about technology, music, movies,  politics and other crap.BTW, this post comes from my iPhone. Trying out the mobile blogger  thingy.Namaste.
