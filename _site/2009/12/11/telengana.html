<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/world/asia/11india.html?_r=1&amp;hp">NYTimes</a> on the formation of Telegana.<br /><br />Is the new state necessary?<br /> I dont know.<br /><br />Will it help in the cause of the millions of people belonging to that region?<br />Possibly, but I definitely see hidden motives for Politicians in this new formation and that might supersede the motives of the people.<br /><br />How to redraw the geographical map in India?<br />Go on a hunger strike until the govt melts down.<br /><br />Will this lead to formation of few more states?<br />The leaders of those movements have to look for alternative means to achieve their goals as the Indian govt may not be appeased by a fast-until-death strike again. Try Bribe-Chidambaram-until-he-agrees.<br /><br /><br />
