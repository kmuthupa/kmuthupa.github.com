<strong>Leave the campground cleaner than you found it!</strong>  - Bob Martin, RailsConf '10

This boy scout thumbrule is so pertinent to software development and clean code.  If every one of the developers on a software development team religiously followed this thumbrule, how clean would the code look? It sounds impractical unless the team here is a bunch of rockstars and clean code fanatics. But it is nevertheless important to educate any team on the importance of this thumbrule and why it is essential to delivering a quality software product.If each member on the team can alteast make a honest effort to adhere to this thumbrule, half the battle is won. The seeds for being better software developers are thus sown.
